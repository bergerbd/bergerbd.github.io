# ArchSec
*ArchSec* automates Microsoft's Threat Modeling process in two ways: First, it automatically extracts architectural
views for component-based software systems. Second, it is capable of automatically identifying security flaws in 
architectural views. Please visit [ArchSec's homepage](https://www.archsec.de) for more details on *ArchSec*.

# CoDaPro
[CoDaPro](https://codapro.de) stands for component-based data processing and is a tool for data measurement, filtering,
and preparation.

# eNYPD
*eNYPD* is a static analysis for identifying entry points of applications. An entry point is any method that an external
user or system can control directly. The information on entry points is necessary in many different security analyses,
such as Threat Modeling, input validation analyses, or security metrics. You can find more information on *eNYPD*
[here](https://uni-bremen-agst.github.io/eNYPD/).

# SeeAuthZ
[SeeAuthZ](https://github.com/uni-bremen-agst/SeeAuthZ) is a configurable analysis tool for extracting the implemented
authorization policy. Therefore, it extracts the authorization facts the program enforces while accessing a sensitive
resource. This information can be used to re-document the authorization policy if the developers lost it or never wrote
it  down or compare the implemented authorization policy with the planned policy to identify divergences.
