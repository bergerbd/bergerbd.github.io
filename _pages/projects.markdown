feature_row_asks:
- title: "ASKS"
  excerpt: "The ASKS project focused on the security analysis of business-critical
  JavaEE applications. The security of the software was analyzed and evaluated based
  on the software architecture. For the project, architectural views of the software
  were extracted using static code analysis and examined for security problems. This
  project was the start of *ArchSec* (see tools section). As part of the ASKS project,
  I was responsible for working on the project work packages.<br/><br/>
  
  *Project duration:* 2010 - 2012 <br />
  *Publications:* [5](./publications#2011), [6](./publications#2012), [7](./publications#2013), [15](./publications#2019)"

feature_row_zertapps:
- title: "ZertApps"
  excerpt: "In the ZertApps project, a lightweight certification concept for
  Android apps was designed. A central component of the certification process
  was static software analysis, which automated and accelerated it. I was
  involved in writing and working on the project.<br/><br/>
  
  *Project duration:* 2014 - 2015 <br />
  *Publications:* [9](./publications#2014), [10](./publications#2014), [11](./publications#2015), [15](./publications#2019)"

  alt: "BMBF logo."

feature_row_secpatterns:
- title: "SecPatterns"
  excerpt: "The SecPatterns project investigated the awareness and distribution
  of security patterns. In addition, existing security patterns were formalized
  so that they could be extracted using static software analysis. The publication
  was created in collaboration with SecPatterns project.

  *Project duration:* 2016 - 2018 <br />
  *Publications:* [16](./publications#2020)"

  alt: "DFG logo."

feature_row_portsec:
- title: "PortSec"
  excerpt: "The PortSec project dealt with IT risk management in port telematics
  based on software architecture. The planned and implemented security architecture
  was extracted using static software analyses and converted into UML/OCL models.
  These were then examined for security problems.

  *Project duration:* 2016 - 2018 <br />
  *Publications:* [14](./publications#2019), [15](./publications#2019)"
