  excerpt: "The ASKS project focused on the security analysis of business-critical
  JavaEE applications. The security of the software was analyzed and evaluated based
  on the software architecture. For the project, architectural views of the software
  were extracted using static code analysis and examined for security problems. This
  project was the start of *ArchSec* (see tools section). As part of the ASKS project,
  I was responsible for working on the project work packages.<br/><br/>
